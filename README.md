## Beebot-Mark-One
Beebot is my first chatbot !  
I build it as a regex training course in my learning path at AI developper with Microsoft and Simplon.  
It was made with a sentiment analysis and some basics. Some cool features are coming...

## Functionalities
Beebot mark one can answer to greetings and personal questions.
It uses also openweathermap API to give the weather via the url >> http://api.openweathermap.org.  

Another pretty cool thing is for the question 'Where are you ?'  
It uses a little code who find your IP address, and with an API it can find your city !

## Sentiment Analysis
In this project, I have used ```python TextBlob``` to analyse sentiments.
